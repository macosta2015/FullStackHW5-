This is the To Do List for homework 5.


### Goal:!

The goal is to do a to do list where it is possible to use the localStorage and save the data into the browser. 

In the following screenshot it is possible to see that the data is being saved in the Local Storage. In that way it is possible 
to refresh the data and the info will still be there.
